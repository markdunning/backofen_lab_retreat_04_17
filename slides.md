# Overview of Bioinformatics Training at CRUK C.I.
### Mark Dunning, Cancer Research Uk Cambridge Institute
### Uk Bioinformatics Core Facilities Meeting
### July 4th 2017
---

# How we started

- Stats course using GraphPad Prism
- Microarray Analysis in Bioconductor
- Experimental Design

---

# What Changed

- Our new Institute Director (a statistican) banned GraphPad Prism
- Pressure from steering committee to provide more training
- Our Institute joined the University
- We got more involved with teaching at the University level

---

# What to teach

Decisions based on:-

- Demands from user (see next slides)
- Topics with existing materials
- Tools / techniques where best pratices are established
  + RNA-seq
- Tools that encourage independance
  + e.g. browsers, web-based

# What people want

(survey results)

---

# What we give them!

- R
  + Introductory 
  + Intermediate (with dpylr and ggplot2)

# Where we teach

- We have to use a seminar room in the institute
  + Limited Availability
  + Everyone brings a laptop and has to install software
  + Extension cables everywhere

#  Costs

(how many hours spent - from Matt?)

---

# Benefits

- Visibility
- Create links with community
- Better interactions between Bioinformatician and Biologist
- Feedback after course is usually positive
  + but we haven't assessed long-term feedback yet
- Discover new technologies
  + docker, notebooks, shiny
- Fun!

---

# What makes a good training course

- Realistic aims and expectations
- Relevant datasets, exercises
- Materials available afterwards
- Friendly, patient and empathetic trainers
